## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Setup
1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Open the `ci-cd.yml` file.
3. Follow the steps in the `ci-cd.yml` file to configure the GitHub Actions workflow:
    - Checkout code
    - Set up Node.js
    - Install dependencies
    - Run tests
    - Build Docker image
    - Push Docker image to repository
    - Deploy to Azure

### Jenkins Setup (Optional)
1. Ensure Jenkins is installed on your server.
2. Open the `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory.
3. Follow the steps in the `Jenkinsfile` to configure the Jenkins pipeline:
    - Checkout code
    - Build Node.js application
    - Run tests
    - Build and push Docker image
    - Deploy to Azure

## Containerization

### Dockerize the Node.js Application
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `Dockerfile`.
3. Follow the steps in the `Dockerfile` to dockerize the Node.js application.

### Docker Compose
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Follow the steps in the `docker-compose.yml` file to run the application along with a MongoDB instance:
    - Define services for the application and MongoDB
    - Set ports for the services
    - Define volumes for MongoDB data persistence

## Cloud Infrastructure

### Terraform Setup
1. Navigate to the `terraform` directory.
2. Open the `main.tf` file.
3. Follow the steps in the `main.tf` file to set up infrastructure as code with Terraform:
    - Define provider (Azure)
    - Create a resource group
    - Create an App Service Plan
    - Create an App Service with Docker configuration

4. Open the `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` files for variable definitions and outputs.
5. Run the following commands to initialize and apply Terraform:
    ```sh
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Prometheus and Grafana
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Follow the steps in the `docker-compose.yml` file to add Prometheus and Grafana services:
    - Define services for Prometheus and Grafana
    - Set ports for the services

4. Open the `prometheus.yml` file in the root directory.
5. Follow the steps in the `prometheus.yml` file to configure Prometheus:
    - Define global scrape interval
    - Configure scrape jobs

### ELK Stack
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Follow the steps in the `docker-compose.yml` file to add ELK stack services:
    - Define services for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
    - Set ports for the services

4. Open the `logstash.conf` file in the root directory.
5. Follow the steps in the `logstash.conf` file to configure Logstash:
    - Define input from Beats
    - Define output to Elasticsearch

    - Application health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`)
    - Prometheus metrics endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`)
    - Grafana dashboards
    - Kibana dashboards
